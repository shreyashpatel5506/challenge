                Nature is the source of all essential nutrients for all living things on the planet, including humans. Humans are part of nature and not separate from it. We go through great expense and trouble to leave our cities and put ourselves into natural environments where we can enjoy these beautiful places. Nature photography brings individuals close to nature and away to the high toxicity of the cities, thus restoring to an extent the physical health. Nature photography is as much a physical exercise as it is the exercise for the soul. Those who are away from nature can't understand the beauty that is held by Nature. The rise in population on planet earth is leading to a rise in consumption of natural resources.

Nature photography is as much a physical exercise as it is the exercise for the soul. By staying close to nature, we feel more grateful and appreciative of what it has to offer to us. We should take full advantage of the nature and go out of home for the morning walk daily to breathe pure air and enjoy morning beauty of nature.  </p>
